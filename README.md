## IMPLEMENTATION/ALGORITHM/GENERAL IDEA

The Popular `ncurses` library is used for the TUI.
Use Linked Lists to Store Tasks. External Storage of Tasks will use JSON.
Merge Sort is used to sort by order.

## WORKING

There are two windows on startup: The Task Window which shows all the Tasks and the Description Window which shows the all the details of the window. Pressing _**F1**_ adds a new Task to the list and _**F2**_ deletes the currently selected task from the list.
Press F10 to exit

## Bugs

- Pressing Arrow Keys while task list empty crashes
- Does not automatically clear description screen
- `printWrapped` segmentation error randomly â†’ I think I fixed it, but be aware.

## NOTES

None for now
